# FingerCounter
This project  counts the number of fingers up on your palm of hand when placed in front of the camera.
I have used CNN Lenet5 architecture for training and testing with Average Pooling .
The count of fingers can be done from 1 to 5.

**This project's uniqueness is that its work very well even though i trained the model with only 100 images for each class.
The training images can be found above with their respective folder as 1,2,3,4 and 5** 

## Running application
Before running the application ensure that you have downloaded the opencv and PIL libraries including keras,
then download the application file, and model weights, open it and change the path of file according to your sytem.
Run the .py file in cmd or anaconda prompt.
You'll see the ouput window with predictions.

Refer to the PPT(see above HandProject) in the repo for info of the project.
